# Inertia.js for ProcessWire

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side frameworks.

Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement to your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two. Inertia comes with three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte).

This is an adapter for https://processwire.com/[ProcessWire]. Inertia replaces PHP views altogether by returning JavaScript components from controller actions. Those components can be built with your frontend framework of choice.

## Installation

You only need to create a file named `templates/app.view.php`. This file will be rendered when calling `$inertia->render()`.
This view will receive a param named `$inertia` that you can use to render the app div.

- `$inertia->page`: The properties that will render.
- `$inertia->json`: The inertia page as a json string.
- `$inertia->tag`: An html div tag with the json string.

Use `$inertia->tag` to render _Inertia's_ root element. If you want more custom element
you can use the `$inertia->json` variable.

```php
<div id='app' data-page='{$inertia->json}'></div>
```

Example `templates/app.view.php`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
  <meta charset='utf-8' />
  <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0'>
  <title>Hello World</title>
  <!-- Your css and js files -->
  <link href='/css/app.css' rel='stylesheet'>
  <script src='/js/app.js' defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <?php echo $inertia->tag ?>
</body>
</html>
```

## Rendering

This adapter follows the https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol[Inertia Protocol].

The very first request to an Inertia app is just a regular full-page browser request, with no special Inertia headers or data. For these requests, the server returns a full HTML document.

Once an Inertia app has been booted, all subsequent requests to the site are made via XHR with a special _X-Inertia_ header set to `true`. This header indicates that the request is being made by Inertia, and isn't a standard full-page visit.

When the server detects the _X-Inertia_ header, instead of responding with a full HTML document, it returns a JSON response with an encoded page object.


Using _Inertia_ with _ProcessWire_ is easy. Just call the `render` function passing the name of your Component and your Properties.

```php
$inertia = $modules->get('Inertia');
echo $inertia->render('MyComponent', ["my" => "props"]);
```
